## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Hello i am doing this frontend challenge, to build out a multi-page website and get it looking as close to design that 
i was given. 
To accomplish this task i will use these tools:
* React-bootstrap
* Loadable-components
* AOS
* React hook form
* React router dom


The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- See the correct content for each team member on the About page when the `+` icon is clicked
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
